# Responsive Design Challenge

A simple webpage project practicing mobile-first responsive design principles, using semantic HTML, BEM, and clean, scalable CSS structures.

This is my solution, made entirely by me (Daniel Stacy), for the final challenge of the Conquering Responsive Layouts - 21 day course by Kevin Powell.

Ideally viewed in a browser with responsive mode enabled in developer mode. Note the viewport width breakpoints of 700 and 1000 pixel widths.
